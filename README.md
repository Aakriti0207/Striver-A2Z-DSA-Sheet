# Striver-A2Z-DSA-Sheet
# DSA with C++ ðŸ’»

This repository contains my solutions to Data Structures and Algorithms problems, primarily using **C++**. Iâ€™m actively following **Striverâ€™s DSA Sheet** and solving problems topic-wise.

## ðŸ“Œ Topics Covered So Far

- Arrays
- Searching & Sorting
- Linked Lists (coming soon!)

## ðŸ“š Resources I'm Following

- Striverâ€™s DSA Sheet: [Link](https://takeuforward.org/interviews/strivers-sde-sheet-top-coding-interview-problems/)
- LeetCode
- GFG (GeeksforGeeks)

  ## ðŸ“Œ How to Run

1. Clone the repo:
2. Open any `.cpp` file in your preferred IDE (CodeBlocks, VSCode)
3. Compile and run the code

## âœ¨ To-Do

- Add problem statements and explanations as comments
- Topic-wise folder structuring
- Time and Space Complexity analysis for each problem
- Add more sorting & binary search problems
